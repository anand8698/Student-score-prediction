# Predictive Analytics for Student Performance

## Project Overview
This project explores the use of machine learning to predict student performance by analyzing factors like attendance, academic history, and personal circumstances. The project integrates a Streamlit-based application to provide real-time predictions, enabling educators to make data-driven decisions and improve academic outcomes.

## Introduction
Educational institutions face challenges in identifying at-risk students and providing timely support. This project leverages predictive analytics to address these challenges by:
- Enabling proactive interventions.
- Highlighting the potential of personalized learning.

## PRISMA Chart
A systematic review of literature using sources such as IEEE, SCIE, and ResearchGate identified six relevant articles, focusing on both original and review studies.

## Research Gap Analysis
1. **Limited Real-Time Applications**: Lack of real-world implementations.
2. **Scalability Challenges**: High computational overhead.
3. **Feature Engineering Needs**: Limited domain-specific customization.

## Objectives
1. Develop machine learning models to predict student performance.
2. Create a user-friendly application using Streamlit.

## Methodology
- Data collection from diverse sources (attendance, grades, behavioral patterns).
- Model development and evaluation using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Deployment via a Streamlit interface for real-time analysis.
